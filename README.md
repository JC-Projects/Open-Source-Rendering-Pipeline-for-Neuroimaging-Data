**ðŸš§WIP**
-
Current future plans are as follows:
- Potential integration of SPM as a replacement for InVesalius to improve .STL topology and allow more fine manipulation outside of Blender
- Incorporate pipeline for CT, PET, MEG and OCT data
- Improve fMRI BOLD pipeline to show multiple frames

**ðŸ”¨TOOLS USED**
- 

 nii2dcm: Used to convert NIFT to DICOM files for InVesalius import

 InVesalius v 3.1.1: Used to QC and mask the converted DICOM file
 
 Blender v4.4: Used to create and modify final render

All work is my own, and any suggestions for improvement or iteration are welcome.
